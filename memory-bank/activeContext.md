# Active Context: Multi-Tenant LMS

## Current Focus

The project is currently focused on three main areas:

1. **Clean Architecture Implementation**
   - Domain-driven design
   - Use case organization
   - Interface adapters
   - Infrastructure layer
   - Service-specific documentation

2. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Component architecture documentation
   - State management implementation
   - Routing system setup
   - Performance optimization

3. **Badge and Certificate System**
   - Badge definition management
   - Progress tracking
   - Achievement criteria
   - Social media integration

## Recent Activities
